            This target acquisition project was one of my first experiments with computer vision in a low-latency
            control system. It utilizes normalized template matching and achieves a configurable confidence threshold
            above 0.8. The system detects visual patterns, predicts spatial positions, and translates that
            information into mechanical actions. This project ignited my interest in how machines perceive
            and interact with their environment.

            This project is a 2D top-down roguelite game that I am actively working on in Java. Developing it
            required me to build a custom 2D rendering engine and draw my own visual assets. I also programmed the
            core gameplay systems from the ground up, including collision detection, movement physics, and
            world interaction. This project taught me to build reliable systems from scratch and to create
            an interactive world that responds to user input.

  <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>
      My intended career in robotics is rooted in the belief that robotics should serve humans. My goal as an engineer
      is to design systems capable of handling hazardous and repetitive tasks, freeing people to focus on more unique
      challenges. To achieve this goal, society must move from automation to collaboration. This requires robots that
      are mechanically reliable and intuitive enough to operate safely alongside humans.
      <br><br>
      I first explored robotics through mechanical engineering, designing an over-terrain vehicle (OTV) drive train
      and navigation algorithm. This navigation system utilized an ultrasound sensor for obstacle detection, relaying
      the distance data to a WiFi module to calculate the necessary path corrections within a three-degree rotation
      tolerance. Watching the OTV successfully navigate the obstacle course, avoiding obstructions and autonomously
      pathfinding to the end site, further reinforced my interest in robotics. This project was one of my first lessons
      in the necessity of hardware and software synergy.
      <br><br>
      Later, while learning to code through game development, I eventually experimented with computer vision to create
      an automated target-acquisition system using OpenCV. This project required me to build a system that could
      dynamically detect visual patterns, predict spatial position, and translate the data into mechanical inputs.
      At the time, I did not fully realize I was exploring the fundamentals of machine perception; I was simply
      fascinated by how a program could interpret and react to its surroundings. This experience of the interaction
      between visual data and physical action is what drew me to AI and further towards robotics.
      <br><br>
      These projects, one focused on physical navigation and the other on digital perception, have shaped my core
      belief: robotics requires deep interdisciplinary respect. My work with the OTV taught me that a programmer
      cannot ignore the constraints of physics, while my experience with OpenCV showed me that an engineer cannot
      overlook the intelligence embedded in the machine.
      <br><br>
      Moving forward, my goal is to develop autonomous systems that function as a partnership between humans and
      robots. I intend to focus my career on creating adaptive interfaces where high-level machine
      perception informs low-level mechanical control, allowing robots to navigate the nuanced unpredictability
      of practical environments. By integrating computerized intelligence and physical reliability,
      I hope to build systems that empower the people they serve.
