  <!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Andrew, and I am a mechanical engineer with an interest
      in programming and robotics. In my spare time, I develop video games and
      experiment with electronics. I intend to have a career in robotics, since
      it combines my passions for engineering and computer science. This portfolio
      showcases the technical projects and experiences that reflect my skills and interests.

            This aimbot project was one of my first experiments with computer vision in a low-latency control system.
            It required me to build a system that could detect visual patterns, predict spatial position, and
            translate the data into mechanical inputs. This project sparked my interest in how machines
            can interact with an environment.

  <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      My philosophy for my career in robotics is rooted in the belief that robotics should serve humans,
      not the other way around. I see robots and artificial intelligence not as human replacements, but as an
      empowerment of current human capabilities, so we can focus on more pressing issues. My objective is to engineer
      autonomous robots that are mechanically reliable, allowing them to operate alongside people.
      <br><br>
      I first explored robotics through mechanical engineering, designing an over-terrain vehicle (OTV) drive train
      and navigation algorithm. These projects gave me a foundation in how autonomous systems interact to produce
      physical outcomes. When the OTV successfully navigated an obstacle course, avoiding obstructions and adjusting
      its path to reach the end site, I realized how much I enjoyed engineering robotics.
      <br><br>
      Later, while learning to code through game development, I eventually experimented with computer vision to create
      an aimbot using OpenCV. Though I didn't fully realize it at the time, I was also teaching myself how
      machines interpret data and estimate spatial position. That curiosity is what first drew me to AI,
      and further interested me in robotics.
      <br><br>
      These experiences shape my core belief: robotics requires interdisciplinary respect and collaboration.
      You can not be a programmer who ignores physics, nor can you be an engineer who ignores the intelligence
      embedded in the machine. This means that the best robots are not defined by their complexity, but rather by
      how their software and hardware work in unison to solve problems. With this belief, I strive to build robots
      that are simple, reliable, and designed with the people they serve in mind.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      The projects in this portfolio show my curiosity and my problem-solving skills. These experiences have also
      strengthened my skills in programming, engineering, and understanding of how machines interact with the world.
      They also reflect my persistence and passion for building intelligent and reliable systems.
